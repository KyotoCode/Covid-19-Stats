# Covid-19-Stats
Web app for displaying covid-19 stats of my country
I made this app using vanila JavaScript, html, css. Data is taken from rest API https://api.covid19api.com/summary. 

You can adapt app for your country by changing UI.js

Example:

info.Countries[147] = data about Serbia 
info.Countries[148] = data about Seychelles etc.
